### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yiqian Wu, a second-year (2021-now) Ph.D. student in State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Xiaogang Jin](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin). I obtained my bachelor degree in computer science and technology from Zhejiang University in 2021.

- My research interest mainly falls on portrait processing (mostly achieved by StyleGAN and 3D-aware GANs).
- My email addresses are: [onethousand@zju.edu.cn](mailto:onethousand@zju.edu.cn) / [onethousand1250@gmail.com](mailto:onethousand1250@gmail.com)
- My personal website: onethousandwu.com 
- I adore painting! You may find the painting videos I released on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/6414209).

Please feel free to ask questions by opening an issue in my repositories; I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
